This is a model with 3 elements. Element 1 has a section definition from ACP, element 2 has a standard section from RST, and 
element 3 has a section definition from RST with 1 layer where the material has to be parsed from the EBLOCK.
This model can be used to verify that the lay-up provider handles all cases and that the ElementInfoProvider supports it as well.
