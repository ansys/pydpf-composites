Thermal analysis
----------------

This example shows how to evaluate a thermal analysis.
The simulation is a two-step analysis where the results of
a thermal analysis are an input of the structural analysis.
Therefore, the RST file contains temperature and structural results.

The example imitates a printed circuit board (PCB) that was 
modeled with Ansys Composites PrepPost (ACP), using the solid model feature to 
generate the volume mesh.

Descriptions of how to extract temperatures for a specific ply
and material are provided.

.. note::

    When using a Workbench project,
    use the :func:`.get_composite_files_from_workbench_result_folder`
    method to obtain the input files.
