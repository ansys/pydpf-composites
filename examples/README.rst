Examples
========
These examples demonstrate the behavior and usage of PyDPF - Composites.
Some additional modules are required to run the examples which can be
installed with the following command:

.. code::

    pip install ansys-dpf-composites[examples]

It is recommended to run the examples in a Jupyter notebook or an IPython console.
Copy / pasting to a standard Python interactive shell can lead to formatting issues (e.g. IndentationError).
